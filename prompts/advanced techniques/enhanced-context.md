To document this COBOL program, I'll provide additional business context that should be incorporated:

COBOL Program:

[PASTE PROGRAM]

Business Context:

- This system processes insurance claims for our healthcare division
- It was originally developed in 1995 and has undergone 12 major revisions
- The most critical business rule is ensuring provider validation against the federal registry
- There are strict regulatory requirements for data retention and audit trails
- The monthly processing volume averages 2.3 million transactions
- The system interfaces with 5 downstream systems for payment processing
- There's a known issue with duplicate transaction detection that requires manual intervention

Create comprehensive Markdown documentation that incorporates both the technical details from the code and this business context to provide a complete understanding of the program.
