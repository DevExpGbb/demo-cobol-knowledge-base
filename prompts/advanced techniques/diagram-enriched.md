Document this COBOL program with an emphasis on visual representations:

[PASTE PROGRAM]

Your documentation should include the following Mermaid diagrams:

1. A hierarchical program structure showing the relationships between paragraphs
2. A flowchart of the main business process
3. A sequence diagram showing interactions with external systems
4. An entity-relationship diagram for the key data structures
5. A state diagram for any status fields that change throughout processing

For each diagram:

1. First explain what the diagram will represent
2. Provide the Mermaid markdown code for the diagram
3. Include a detailed explanation of what the diagram shows

These visualizations should complement the regular Markdown text documentation that explains the program's purpose, functionality, and implementation details.
