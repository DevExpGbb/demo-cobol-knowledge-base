Create a two-column Markdown documentation approach for this COBOL program:

[PASTE PROGRAM]

In the left column, provide the technical explanation including:

- Code structure and organization
- Variable definitions and data structures
- Control flow and processing logic
- Technical implementation details
- Performance considerations

In the right column, provide the corresponding business perspective:

- Business purpose of each section
- Business rules implemented
- Business exceptions handled
- Business impact of errors
- Business context for design decisions

This dual-perspective approach should help bridge the gap between technical and business stakeholders, allowing both to understand the program from their perspective.
