Document this COBOL program:

[PASTE PROGRAM]

After generating each section of documentation, evaluate it against these criteria:

1. Completeness: Does it cover all aspects of the code?
2. Clarity: Would a developer unfamiliar with the code understand it?
3. Technical accuracy: Does it correctly explain all COBOL constructs?
4. Business context: Does it explain why the code works this way?
5. Practical value: Does it help with maintenance or migration?

If any section doesn't meet these criteria, revise it before proceeding. Include your evaluation reasoning for each section.
