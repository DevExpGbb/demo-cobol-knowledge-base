Based on the COBOL codebase previously shared, help me identify the highest risk areas for modernization:
1. Which components have the most complex business logic?
2. What are the potential data integrity challenges during migration?
3. Which areas might contain undocumented business rules?
4. What transaction patterns would be difficult to replicate in a modern architecture?

For each risk area, suggest an approach to mitigate the risk.
