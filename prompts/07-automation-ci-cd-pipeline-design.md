We need to establish a CI/CD pipeline for a hybrid environment with both COBOL/mainframe components and modern [TARGET PLATFORM] components. 

Design a pipeline that addresses:
1. Source control strategies for COBOL code
2. Automated testing of mainframe components
3. Integration testing across legacy and modern boundaries
4. Deployment strategies that minimize risk
5. Monitoring and rollback procedures
