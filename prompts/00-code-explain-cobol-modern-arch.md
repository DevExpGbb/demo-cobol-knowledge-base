Using this COBOL program as an example:

[PASTE REPRESENTATIVE PROGRAM]

Create a Markdown knowledge transfer guide that:
1. Explains COBOL-specific concepts for modern developers
2. Maps COBOL programming constructs to equivalent patterns in [TARGET LANGUAGE]
3. Explains mainframe environmental considerations that impact the code
4. Documents transaction processing models and their modern equivalents
5. Provides a glossary of COBOL/mainframe terminology with modern definitions
6. Includes a "translation guide" for common coding patterns

Design this document specifically for developers familiar with modern languages but new to COBOL.
