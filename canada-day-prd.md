# Product Requirements Document: Canada Day Holiday Determination

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the requirements for a COBOL routine that determines whether a given date falls on Canada Day, enabling enterprise systems to correctly identify this Canadian statutory holiday for business processing, payroll calculations, and operational scheduling.

### 1.2 Business Context
Canada Day is observed annually on July 1st to commemorate the formation of Canada. When July 1st falls on a weekend, the holiday may be observed on a different date for certain business purposes, though the actual holiday remains July 1st.

### 1.3 Scope
The routine will provide a standardized method for identifying Canada Day within enterprise COBOL applications, supporting both exact date matching and business day observance rules.

## 2. Business Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

#### FR-001: Date Validation
- The system SHALL accept input dates in YYYYMMDD format
- The system SHALL validate input date format and reject invalid dates
- The system SHALL handle leap years correctly

#### FR-002: Canada Day Identification
- The system SHALL identify July 1st of any given year as Canada Day
- The system SHALL return a clear indicator when the input date is Canada Day
- The system SHALL support years from 1867 (Confederation) onwards

#### FR-003: Weekend Observance Rules
- The system SHALL provide an option to determine observed Canada Day date
- When July 1st falls on Saturday, the observed date SHALL be Friday, June 30th
- When July 1st falls on Sunday, the observed date SHALL be Monday, July 2nd
- The system SHALL clearly distinguish between actual and observed dates

#### FR-004: Error Handling
- The system SHALL provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
- The system SHALL handle boundary conditions gracefully
- The system SHALL not terminate abnormally for any valid input range

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR-001: Performance
- The routine SHALL execute within 100 milliseconds for any single date check
- The routine SHALL support batch processing of multiple dates

#### NFR-002: Maintainability
- The code SHALL follow enterprise COBOL coding standards
- The routine SHALL be documented with clear comments
- The logic SHALL be modular and testable

#### NFR-003: Compatibility
- The routine SHALL be compatible with Enterprise COBOL compilers
- The routine SHALL integrate with existing date processing systems

| OBSERVANCE-FLAG | PIC X(1) | 1 | Check observed vs actual | 'Y'=Observed, 'N'=Actual |

### 3.2 Output Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Length | Description | Valid Values |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| CANADA-DAY-FLAG | PIC X(1) | 1 | Canada Day indicator | 'Y'=Yes, 'N'=No |
| OBSERVED-DATE | PIC 9(8) | 8 | Observed holiday date | YYYYMMDD format |
| RETURN-CODE | PIC 9(2) | 2 | Processing result | 00=Success, 01-99=Error |

### 3.3 Business Rules

#### BR-001: Canada Day Definition
- Canada Day is always July 1st, regardless of day of week
- The holiday exists from 1867 onwards (Canadian Confederation)

#### BR-002: Observance Rules
- If July 1st falls on Saturday, observed date is June 30th
- If July 1st falls on Sunday, observed date is July 2nd
- If July 1st falls on Monday-Friday, observed date equals actual date

#### BR-003: Validation Rules
- Input year must be >= 1867
- Input month must be 01-12
- Input day must be valid for the given month and year
- Date must not exceed system maximum date (9999-12-31)

### 3.4 Error Codes

| Code | Description | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 00 | Success | Continue processing |
| 01 | Invalid date format | Check input format |
| 02 | Invalid year (< 1867) | Use valid year range |
| 03 | Invalid month | Use month 01-12 |
| 04 | Invalid day | Check calendar for valid day |
| 05 | Future date beyond system limit | Use supported date range |

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 Program Structure
- Follow standard COBOL division structure
- Use descriptive paragraph names (e.g., 1000-VALIDATE-INPUT-DATE)
- Implement centralized error handling (9000-ERROR-HANDLING)
- Include comprehensive program documentation

### 4.2 Data Validation
- Validate all input parameters before processing
- Use numeric validation for date components
- Implement bounds checking for all date parts

### 4.3 Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all date validation scenarios
- Test cases for leap years (1896, 1900, 2000, 2004)
- Test cases for weekend observance rules
- Boundary testing for minimum/maximum dates
- Error condition testing for invalid inputs

## 5. Integration Considerations

### 5.1 Copybook Integration
- Define standard copybook for Canada Day processing
- Include in enterprise date processing library
- Maintain version control for copybook changes

### 5.2 System Integration
- Compatible with existing payroll systems
- Supports batch processing frameworks
- Integrates with holiday management systems

## 6. Documentation Requirements

### 6.1 Technical Documentation
